= Docker image to generate a customized Eclipse installation

To use it :

    $ docker build -t eclipse-custom .
    $ docker run -v `pwd`/custom-eclipse:/eclipse-provisioned eclipse

That will create a directory called `custom-eclipse` in which you'll find the `eclipse` directory corresponding
to your customized Eclipse.

Then, as Docker runs as root, to use it without any issue, you should `chown` that directory to your current user:

    $ sudo chown -R $( id -un ):$( id -gn ) custom-eclipse
